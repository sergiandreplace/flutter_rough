# Rough

Rough is a library that allows you draw in a sketchy, hand-drawn-like style. It's a direct port of [Rough.js](https://roughjs.com/).

## Installation

In the `dependencies:` section of your `pubspec.yaml`, add the following line:

```yaml
dependencies:
  rough: <latest_version>
```
## Basic usage

Right now only drawing via canvas is supported. This is a basic documentation in case you want to play around with Rough. I can't ensure non-breaking changes of the library interface.

To draw a figure you have to:

1. Create a `DrawConfig` object to determine how your drawing will look.
2. Create a `Filler` to be used when drawing objects (you have to provide a configuration for the filling and a `DrawConfig` for the filling path).
3. Create a `Generator` object using the created `DrawConfig` and `Filler`. This will define a drawing/filling style.
4. Invoke the drawing method from the `Generator` to create a `Drawable`.
5. Paint the `Drawable` in the canvas using the `drawRough` method extension for `Canvas`.

Here an example on how to draw a circle:

```dart
//Create a `DrawConfig` object.
DrawConfig myDrawConfig = DrawConfig.build(
  roughness: 3,
  curveStepCount: 14,
  maxRandomnessOffset: 3,
);

//Create a `Filler` with a configuration (we reuse the drawConfig in this case).
FillerConfig myFillerConfig = FillerConfig.build(
    hachureGap: 8,
    hachureAngle: -20,
    drawConfig: myDrawConfig,
);
Filler myFiller = ZigZagFiller(myFillerConfig);

//Create a `Generator` with the created `DrawConfig` and `Filler`
Generator generator = Generator(
  myDrawConfig,
  myFiller,
);

//4. Build a circle `Drawable`.
Drawable figure = generator.circle(200, 200, 320);

//5. Paint the `Drawable` in the canvas.
Canvas.drawRough(figure, pathPaint, fillPaint);
```

And this is the result:

Both `DrawConfig` and `FillerConfig` will use default values for anything not specified.
